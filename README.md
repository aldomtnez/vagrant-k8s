# vagrant-k8s

Vagrant Deploy for Kubernetes Cluster

Will be deploying one master node with two workers, using containerd as CRI and callico as CNI.

clone repository and then execute vagrant up

$ cd vagrant-k8s && vagrant up

the information for setup a kubectl client will be written at the end of the file created on /home/vagrant/kubeinit.log

hope this helps some one!
